### **Chapter 14: Docker Networking**  
#### **Title: Connecting Containers with Docker Networking**

### **ðŸ”¹ What is Docker Networking?**  
Docker provides **built-in networking capabilities** that allow containers to **communicate** with each other and the outside world.  
Each container gets its own **isolated network stack** but can be connected using Dockerâ€™s network types.  

---
### **ðŸ›  Types of Docker Networks**  

| Network Type | Description | Use Case |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Bridge** (default) | Isolated container network with NAT for external access | Standard container networking |
| **Host** | Container shares hostâ€™s network namespace (no isolation) | High-performance local apps |
| **None** | No network interface (completely isolated) | Security-sensitive workloads |
| **Overlay** | Network for multi-host communication (Swarm/Kubernetes) | Distributed applications |
| **Macvlan** | Assigns MAC addresses to containers (like physical devices) | Network virtualization |

---
### **ðŸ”¹ Bridge Network (Default)**  
- Containers can communicate **within the same network** but need **port mapping** to expose services externally.  
- Example: Running two containers on a bridge network  
```sh
docker network create my-bridge
docker run -d --name app1 --network my-bridge nginx
docker run -d --name app2 --network my-bridge alpine sleep 1000
```
- **Test connection:**  
```sh
docker exec -it app2 ping app1
```
ðŸ“Œ Containers **can communicate** because they share the same bridge network.

---
### **ðŸ”¹ Exposing a Container to the Host**  
- Containers donâ€™t expose ports automatically. You need to map them using `-p`.  
- Example: Running a web server on port 8080  
```sh
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```
ðŸ‘‰ The containerâ€™s **port 80** is mapped to **port 8080** on the host.

### **ðŸ”¹ Host vs. Bridge Networking**  

| Feature | Bridge Network | Host Network |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Isolation** | Containers isolated | No isolation (uses host network) |
| **Performance** | NAT translation overhead | Faster (direct access to host) |
| **Security** | More secure | Less secure (host exposed) |
| **Port Mapping** | Required (`-p`) | Not needed |

ðŸ“Œ **Use `host` networking for low-latency applications** but prefer `bridge` for security.
