### **Chapter 8: Namespaces & Cgroups**  
#### **Title: How Docker Provides Process Isolation**  
---

### **ðŸ”¹ What are Namespaces?**  
Namespaces are a **Linux kernel feature** that provides **isolation** for different aspects of system resources.  
Each container gets its own **namespace**, making it appear as if it's running on a separate system.  

---
### **ðŸ›  Key Docker Namespaces**  

| Namespace | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **PID (Process ID)** | Isolates process trees (each container has its own PID space) |
| **NET (Networking)** | Gives each container its own network stack (IP, ports, routes) |
| **MNT (Mounts)** | Provides isolated file system views |
| **UTS (Hostname)** | Allows containers to have their own hostname |
| **IPC (Interprocess Communication)** | Ensures shared memory and messaging are container-specific |

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**  
ðŸ‘‰ Run a container and check its process isolation:  
```sh
docker run -d --name test-container ubuntu sleep 1000
ps aux | grep sleep
```
ðŸ”¹ The process runs inside the container, isolated from the host.

---
### **ðŸ”¹ What are Cgroups (Control Groups)?**  
Cgroups **limit and monitor** system resources for containers.  
They prevent containers from **consuming too much CPU, RAM, or disk I/O**.  

---
### **ðŸ›  Cgroups in Action**  

| Resource | Controlled by Cgroups? |
|----------|----------------------|
| **CPU** | âœ… Limits how much CPU a container can use |
| **Memory** | âœ… Restricts RAM allocation per container |
| **Disk I/O** | âœ… Controls read/write speed for storage |
| **Network Bandwidth** | âœ… Can restrict network usage |

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**  
ðŸ‘‰ Limit memory usage to **256MB** for a container:  
```sh
docker run -d --memory=256m --name limited-container ubuntu sleep 1000
```
