### **What is Docker?**
- Docker is an **open-source containerization platform** that allows developers to build, package, and distribute applications in **lightweight, portable containers**.
- Containers **encapsulate applications and their dependencies**, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- Unlike traditional virtual machines, Docker containers **share the host OS kernel**, making them more efficient.

### **Why Use Containers Instead of VMs?**
| Feature        | Virtual Machines (VMs) | Docker Containers |
|---------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Isolation    | Full OS per VM | Shares OS kernel |
| Performance  | Slower (OS overhead) | Faster (low overhead) |
| Portability  | Tied to specific OS/hardware | Runs anywhere with Docker |
| Startup Time | Minutes | Seconds |
| Size | Several GBs | MBs |

### **Pros and Cons of Docker**
#### **Pros:**
✅ Lightweight and efficient  
✅ Consistent development environments  
✅ Scalable and portable  
✅ Faster deployment process  

#### **Cons:**
❌ Security concerns (shared kernel)  
❌ Complex networking configurations  
❌ Learning curve for advanced features
